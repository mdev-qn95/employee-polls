# Employee Polls

The starter code will consist of a \_DATA.js file, which represents a fake database and contains methods that let you access the data. The README file outlines how the data is stored and details the methods you can use to access the database.

The only thing you need to edit in the \_DATA.js file is the value of avatarURL. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add a path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you will build a React/Redux front end for the application.

The source code is hosted at the repo [Employee Polls](https://github.com/mdev-qn95/employee-polls).
